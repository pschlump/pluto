= A generics based Go Stack.

A simple stack with Push, Pop, Length, IsEmpty using Go generics.

This requires version 1.18beta1 of Go to be compiled and used.

This is a demo of how to use a generic in a type decleration and how to
delcare methods on that generic type.  Specifically look at the decleration
of `Stack[T any]` and also see how the functions are instanciated with
the generic type.

The code is a conversion of an erlier `Stack` that used `interface{}`.
