== Commonly used Data Structures

Let’s first list the most commonly used data structures, and then we’ll cover them one by one:

. Arrays
. Stacks
. Queues
. Linked Lists
. Trees
. Graphs
. Tries (they are effectively trees, but it’s still good to call them out separately).
. Hash Tables

1. Don't be a one-true-way person
	. keep your eyes on the goal
	. remember that there are many ways to solve a problem
	. remember that you don't have the only way
	. remember that all rules have exceptions
	. remember that "pretty" code that is broken is much worse than "ugly" code that works.
	. objects and OOP are only 1 way to approach a problem - and may not be the best way.
		. consider a pure-funcaitonal solution
		. consider graphs and state machines
		. consider push-down atomata
		. consider a different data structure
	. hiding data in OOP means less tests and lower quality code


Connect type://ip:port/database?un=X&pw=Y
	Type := https | http | gRPC => 17210 | jsonrpc => 16210 

	with https/http - parameters are passed via "post" with __method__=post (get is not used)


== Critical Observations about API and Data

. Web applications need an API to data
. SQL/single-table is a lousy way to dal with data (normalized data is not UI/UX ready)
. UI/UX needs complex data (multi-table, documents, map[name]stuff + Secuirty)
. Redis is not a good store for web-data because
	. it is not persistent
	. name/vlaue or name-data-structure is not "searchable"
. MongoDB is not a good store for data because
	. it is documents
	. it is not ACID compliant
	. 



1. Goal : High speed binary cached data.  (need a speed comparable to memcached)
	. gRPC
	. binary
	. set/get operations
	. data timeout
	. LRU cache
	. cache invalidations
	. pub/sub with cache invalidations (sub on chanel -> invalidation)
2. Better Complex Data Structures
	. name -> set of X (searilized)
	. set of X
	. list of X
	. stack of X
	etc...
	X can contain ... (complex hierarcial data structurs)

Commands:

. set A b						cmd_set
. setex A b TTL					cmd_setx
. setexx A b TTL.ms				cmd_setxx
. event name TTL				cmd_event
. eventx name TTL.ms			cmd_eventx

. define name ...

. set --persist A b

. set --persist --immutable A b
. set -p -i A b

. set --ttl X a b

. keys pattern

. keys --datestart X --dateend XZ

. 


. CMD [ options ]* Params


== Structured Data (JSON etc)

== SQL?






key-cli --un x --pw y --database z
