= A generics based Go Queue.

A simple stack with Push, Pop, Length, IsEmpty using Go generics.

This requires version 1.18beta1 of Go to be compiled and used.

This queue implemenation is based on using a generic DLL and the
performance will be significantly different when poping
values thatn a queue based on a doublly linked list.  In this
implentation a copy of the queued dat ais made each time a
`Pop` occures.  This will result in an order(n) performance
for this operation.
A DLL based queue has a order(1) timing for the
same operation.
