= An Introduction to Go Generics.

For about a decade the Go language has not had generic types.
Even without this it has proven to be a very useful language.

NOTE: In 2022 Go 1.18 will add generics.  At the current time all of
the code in this is being tested with the pre-relase go1.18beta1
verions of go.   This will all be re-tested next year (Its December
2021) when the official 1.18 version is released.
