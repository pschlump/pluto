= An Introduction to Go Generics, Iterators and Interfaces

For the first decade the Go language did not have generic types.  This was
one of the major complaints that people from other languages claimed as
a reason for not adopting Go.   Go added generics in version 1.18 and
as of version 1.23 experimantal version has added a very clever implementation
of iterators.

The combination of these makes building a set of generic-based data types
both useful and instructive.  Most of the examples of using Go generics
are simple and fail to showcase the intracacies of Go generics.  This
library is fundamentally different.  The interaction (good interaction) of
Go generics, Go iterators, Go interfaces, and concurrency and Go routines.

This set of data structures includes some more advanced datastructues
like AVL trees and why AVL was chosen instead of Red/Black balanced trees.
