Caching Symbol Table (hash_tab.go)
	For example save Regexp from MustCompile based on string
SymbolTable for a language project 








// ifTrue(ls=="yes",fmt.Sprintf("setLocalStorage(%q,new%s) ", kk, strings.Title(kk)),"")
func ifTrue(b bool, a, b string) string {
	if b {
		return a
	}
	return b
}


1. heap - add array of data / hepify
2. sll(any) - re-test 
3. sll(walk) / Iter
4. binary_tree - iter (ycombinator)

	Priority Q - Heap Based
	Priority Q - DLL based

	Circular Queue









CLI/Server:
	What about a shared gRPC based tool (server) that has data in it.
	Make the tool extensible to multiple named services
	Add in actual security so you can expose it over the net
	Have a "CLI" that allows access/testing
	Have a web interface
	Allow "tracking" of data structures - so you can watch them chainge (for debuging / understanding)
	Render d.s. into GUI graphs (tree,heep,etc)
	Faster than Redis / Better to Understand than memcached.

	Make it extensible!








TextTemplates with go generics
	- extend to have blocks
	- extend to use data better

PgDatabase (pgx) with tempaltes
	- Type passed in to describe Projected Columns of Select
	- Type passed in to describe bind vars

	Binary Heap

	n-Ary tree
